# Ohayon-Sequencer

A user friendly interface for sequencing DNA along with tools for sequence manipulation and base pairing analysis. 

Features include:
- Sequencer Reverse/Complement converted
- Ability to sequence Loop DNA
- Ability to find strongest base pairing configuration between two strands


Frontend: React JS/Flux
Dependancy Management: Webpack
Backend:NodeJS/Express/Java

NOTE: Must use Node version 6.9.4 or Node@6 (homebrew) 

___________________________________________________________

Future Updates will include:

 - Desired DNA melting points for strand components


Testing: 

1. Go to console and enter "npm run server"

2. On web browser go to localhost:3000
